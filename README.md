# wildporg Bypass++

## What is it?
Bypass++ is a user script program that gives you the option of using a google hosted site, a bit like a proxy to access content. It can be used in use cases such as bypassing dns blocks and general website blocking at home, work, or school.

## How do you install it?

There are two ways, using a chrome extension, and just using it in the browser. To use the chrome extension, continue reading. To use it with just a normal browser, go to the no extension page. ([./no-extension/](https://github.com/wildporg/wildporg-bypass-plus-plus/tree/main/no-extension))

It's pretty simple really, and there are 3 main steps.
- Install TamperMonkey (or any user script manager)
- Import the script
- Use it

Ok, here's that same thing but more in depth.

- Installing Tampermonkey

Tampermonkey is easily installed by going to your extensions store e.g Chrome Web Store for Google Chrome, or Microsoft Store for Microsoft Edge (Chrome Web Store can also be used for Microsoft Edge) and clicking add to browser.

Chrome:

```
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/
```

Edge:
```
https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/tampermonkey/iikmkjmpaadaobahmlepeloendndfphd?hl=zh-CN
```

Firefox:

```
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/
```

- Importing the script

Once Tampermonkey is installed, click the extensions button in the top right of your browser (it may be somewhere else),

then click Tampermonkey and after that dashboard. Now go to utilities, copy the script link from github and paste it in Import from url at the bottom. Click install, then install, and it should be finished!

- Using Bypass++

To use Bypass++ go to your desired website, and click the arrow at the top of the page and click ok. This will redirect you to the google hosted / google proxied page. Any url bugs or other issues please notify me here or email me at help@wildporg.com. Thanks for installing!
