# wildporg Bypass++

## What is it?
Bypass++ is a javascript program that gives you the option of using a google hosted site, a bit like a proxy to access content. It can be used in use cases such as bypassing dns blocks and general website blocking at home, work, or school.

## How do you use it?

To use Bypass++ go to your desired website, type "javascript:" into the url bar, paste the code and click ok. This will redirect you to the google hosted / google proxied page. Any url bugs or other issues please notify me here or email me at help@wildporg.com. Thanks for installing!
